"""
The objective of this script is to take a verse in the quran and find it's root words from corpus.quran.com's
word-by-word section.

The eventual goal is to store all of the root words for a verse in a database and create an API
specifically for the root words. We could then use this API for ourselves and share it with the
public (i.e. future developers).
